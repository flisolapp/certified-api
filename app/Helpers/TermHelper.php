     * Prepares a given search term by trimming it, converting it to lowercase if it's an email,

     * The method processes a search term as follows:
     * 1. Trims any leading and trailing whitespace from the term.
     * 2. Checks if the term is in a valid email format.
     * 3. If the term is an email, it converts the term to lowercase for consistency.
     * 4. If the term is not an email, it removes all characters except numbers and unaccented letters.
     * 5. Throws an exception if the term is null, an empty string after trimming, or doesn't match the expected patterns.
     *
     * @param string|null $term The search term to be prepared. Can be a string or null.
     * @return string The processed term: if it's an email, it's trimmed and converted to lowercase;
     *                if it's not an email, it's trimmed and cleansed of non-alphanumeric characters.
     *                Throws an exception if the term is null, an empty string, or doesn't match the expected formats.
     *
     * @throws InvalidArgumentException If the term is invalid, indicating that a non-empty search term is required.
